# CALIOPmatlab

Matlab routines to open and plot CALIOP data, the lidar on board the
CALIPSO satellite from NASA (https://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/). The
focus is on the vertical feature mask (VFM) data, sometimes also
called Feature Classification Flag.

This projects builds upon the original Matlab code by Ralph Kuehn
(U. of Wisconsin-Madison,
https://espo.nasa.gov/gasex/person/Ralph_Kuehn) that can be accessed
at the CALIPSO website here (see section *Layout of the Feature
Classification Flag data block*):
